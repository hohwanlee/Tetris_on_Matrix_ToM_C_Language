# What I learned through this project : 
1. How to use GitHub and how to connect to Visual Studio IDE.

2. How to upload, edit, commit with GitHub.

3. How to make games on Textual User Interface (TUI) such as putty. I used various system calls including poll to make wait for input.

# What I felt during this project : 

1. I realized that cross platform game engine like Unreal Engine is much more better. Adopting to new enviroment like terminal IO system is taking so much time to research and implement.

2. Another thing I learned is that Object-Oriented Programming is much better when programming a game. Using just C is low productivity. On the contrary, when I programmed in Java Android, it was smooth and fast.

# Things can be improved : 

1. Next block showing.

2. Gameover

3. Store the highest score in file or web.

# Personal Conclusion : 

I had enough fun with Teris on Putty.

I don't think I will keep developing text based game.

I will develop different software like web server or games in proper game engines like Unreal Engine.
