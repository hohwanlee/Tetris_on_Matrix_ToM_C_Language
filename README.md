# Tetris on Matrix (ToM) C Language Version
Tetris on Matrix (ToM) is a game designed to be played on Putty with default settings (80x24, Courier New)

Matrix is a Linux system where Seneca college students submit assignments and practice with Linux.

It is just a personal project for fun.

It is named as 'Tetris on Matrix' to give the rhythm.

# What I learned through this project : 
1. How to use GitHub and how to connect to Visual Studio IDE.

2. How to upload, edit, commit with GitHub, including pictures.

3. How to make games on Textual User Interface (TUI) such as Putty. I used various system calls, including poll to wait for input.

# What I felt during this project : 

1. I realized that cross-platform game engines like Unreal Engine are much better. Adapting to new environments like the terminal IO system is taking so much time to research and implement.

2. Another thing I learned is that Object-Oriented Programming is much better when programming a game. Using just C is low productivity. On the contrary, when I programmed in Java Android, it was smooth and fast.

# Things can be improved : 

1. Next block showing.

2. Gameover

3. Store the highest score in file or web.

# Personal Conclusion : 

I had enough fun with Teris on Putty.

I don't think I will keep developing text-based games.

I will develop different software like web servers or games in proper game engines like Unreal Engine.
