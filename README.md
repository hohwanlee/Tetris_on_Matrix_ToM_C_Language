# What I learned through this project : 

1. How to use GitHub and how to connect to Visual Studio IDE.

2. How to upload, edit, commit with GitHub.

3. How to make games on Textual User Interface (TUI) such as putty. I used various system calls including poll to make wait for input.

# What I felt during this project : 

1. I realized that cross platform game engine like Unreal Engine is much more better. Adopting to new enviroment like terminal IO system is taking so much time to research and implement.

2. Another thing I learned is that Object-Oriented Programming is much better when programming a game. Using just C is low productivity. On the contrary, when I programmed in Java Android, it was smooth and fast.
